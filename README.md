Hello there!

Here I am following The Odin Project tutorial, on VM, typing all kind of things in CLI.
And I have to admit, this was one of the areas that I completely looked over, and
it actually went pretty along with plans of learning more about GIt, and 
re-learning HTML/CSS so I could have easier time learning SASS.
